text parsing automation script. script uses python to listen and transcribe audio and then parses it and pastes the output to the iMessage Window on a desktop via autogui.

## potential enhancements
* Access iMessage programatically - currently app relies on user opening and having the window in a clickable vicinity for pyautogui
* Download and transcribe audio instead of listening to active audio
* Use OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe
